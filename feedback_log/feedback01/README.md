<!-- • The logo  at the top should be bigger maybe a bigger width. -->
<!-- • The “Why DD?” can that just be “Why Diamond Development?” I show my auntie and she didn’t know what DD means. We can add the word Diamond Development, and keep the DD. We can just put the words Diamond development below “Why DD?” -->
<!-- • Can we change the Phone number it says 24/7 and that’s a lot on my number -->
<!-- • We need to add a LinkedIn Icon -->
<!-- • In the Talk to Us section… where you said, “hit us up” can we put “talk to us” instead. -->

The last two sections (what our clients say and talk to us):

• could benefit from and increase in margins
<!-- - Switch about to the dimaond way -->
<!-- -learn more button go to tornado blue page with dumb ass text -->
<!-- • I think you can switch the services and about links in the navigation
- make “the Diamond way” page the about page -->
<!-- - then services can include the next 3 pages -->
<!-- • the “learn more” button on the home page does nothing -->
<!-- - I think it could just be a link to another section on the page i.e. the one under “why d.d.?” -->
• also, I can see the tomorrow font working in SOME areas . So maybe that’s a plus 👍🏽🤷🏽‍♀️🤣

<!-- To be picky:
• the “talk to us” page has a shorter height than the rest of the sections -->
<!-- • and the “home” page has a slightly taller height than the rest of the sections -->
